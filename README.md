# oci-nigthly-stop
Stop your OCI instances at night.

# Supported instances for stop
- Compute Instances
- Autonomous Databases
- Database nodes of database systems (VM and Baremetal)
- Analytics Cloud Instances

This script will start and stop all compute, Autonomous, database and analytics instances within a tenancy. Specific resources can be tagged so that they will not be started and stopped, or the lines for the specific types of resources can be removed from the botton of the `start.py` and `stop.py` files

# Prerequisites
- oci-cli (https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm)
- Pre-created oci-cli config file (~/.oci/config). 
- You can create by `oci setup config` command and assumed DEFAULT profile in the `~/.oci` path. To use a different path and profile, the `start.py` and `stop.py` files must be edited to reflect those changes.
- Python 3 and above (https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- oci python SDK (https://oracle-cloud-infrastructure-python-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

    ```

6. If you want to exclude instances from stopping, set defined tags below for individual compute, db-systems or autnoumous database instances.
